How To Prove Income
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are self-employed or work on commission, you may find that you
need to prove your income in order to qualify for a loan or other type
of credit. Here are a few ways to do that:

1. Show your tax returns. This is the most common and straightforward
way to show proof of income. If you can't provide your most recent tax
return, you may be able to get a transcript from the IRS.

2. Provide bank statements. Lenders will often accept a few months of
personal or business bank statements as proof of income.

3. Offer an accounting of your work. If you work on commission or do
freelance work, you can provide potential lenders with an accounting of
your work over the past few months. This should include invoices,
contracts, or other documentation that shows how much you earned.

4. Get a letter from your employer. If you are employed but don't earn a
regular paycheck, you may be able to get a letter from your employer
stating your annual salary or average pay over the past few months.

5. Use a cosigner. If you are having trouble proving your income, you
may be able to get a cosigner for your loan. This person will be
responsible for repaying the loan if you default, so make sure you
choose someone you trust.
